       What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing <br>and  typesetting industry.Lorem Ipsum has been the  industry's standard dummy text <br> ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of <br>type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has<br> survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s<br> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including<br> versions of Lorem Ipsum.        
               
     Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical<br> Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <br>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College<br> in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, <br>consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the<br> cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable<br> source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of<br> "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)<br> by Cicero, written in 45 BC.<br> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during<br> the Renaissance. The first line of<br> Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line<br> in section 1.10.32.
